# Predictive Maintenance ML API

A full MLOps pipeline for predicting machine failures based on sensor telemetry data. This repository includes data preprocessing, model training and tracking with MLflow, inference with FastAPI, and containerization with Docker.

## ðŸš€ Â¡IMPORTANT! For a quick test of the model, go directly to the README.md file in the "ready to use" folder. There you will find instructions on how to run the model quickly.
